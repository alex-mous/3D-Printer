These are the configuration files for the Marlin firmware. They have been adjusted to work with this 3D printer. Changes made to the files have been documented by putting //CHANGED after the changed code. Download Marlin at marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install.html. Then copy these configuration files into the directory with the other .h and .cpp files. See marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html for uploading the code to the Arduino Mega controller. See github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin for the original configuration files.
