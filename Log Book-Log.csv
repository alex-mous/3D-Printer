110,09/02/19,5,1," cleanup and fix extruder to extruder mount and also to printer (added nuts and cleaned edges), also start V4 of extruder carriage after discovering need for fan for prints also (now also changing XY Joiner so rods on top of each other as opposed to next to each other). Also add bearing mount V1.1 and discover Z bed not straight. Bed bends down towards side without Z lead screw. Try to remedy by adding plates to the bottom of the bed, but only fixes slightly. Research more motors (another already requested because this one is bent and grates) and decide to use both. Try printing V3 of Z Bearing Clamp, which has a cross brace form the bottom, but find holes not quite aligned properly, so design V3.1 and printing tomorrow (marked as Z rods to bed plate connector in designs). Also print test part for extruder carriage, and testing tomorrow."
111,10/02/19,4,53," test hotend carriage test part and works (screw to adjust spacing of bushings), print V3.1 of z rods to bed connector (aka bearing clamp). Decide to redesign whole X and Y axes because fan won't fit on carriage and axis movement already severely limited, so design new motor mount (V1 and then up to V1.3 correcting small errors without printing) and also design idler bearing mount (still V1). Print z bed plate to rods connector and attach, analyzing effect tomorrow but on first glance seems to lessen sag. Also start out designing 12mm rod clamp for V2 X and Y axes."
112,11/02/19,3,50," print motor mount V1.3 and find holes too close together so update and print again in V1.4, next print and find holes still not good so design V1.5 for tomorrow; also try another method for the bed: move the outer parts in and ad two more 90-degree brackets and now also allows to add to top plates; this method seems to work well and hardly warps/flexes/bends/distorts at all (but testing over next few days to see if sags. Also design V2  of steel rod clamp for V2 x and y axes, printing tomorrow also designed XY joiner."
113,12/02/19,4,2," print one of V1.1 bearing mount, subsequently design V1.2 because idler bearing don't fit, straightened Z axes by locking calipers @ 110mm and adjusting mount for 10mm rods. Edited/picked out bad pictures."

116,15/02/19,3,52," Nicole Ou asks me to pay $3 for shipping, paid, and hopefully shipping soon. Lin Chris gave tracking number. Print another motor mount and another idler mount and cleanup and install. Also print another V2.3 of 12mm clamp type 1 and printing another type 2 V2.4 tomorrow. Tested XY joiner and found placement of inner divider not ideal, bearing clamp too tight and not enough space to put in idler bearing so designed V1.4 and then V1.5."
116,15/02/19,0,53,Print of 12mm clamp fails due to not sticking to bed.
117,16/02/19,6,42,"Work on new 3D printer: finish designing Hotend Carriage, design Fan mount on carriage; design fan vent to direct fan air and also test part; cleanup printer after two failed print yesterday (plastic all over hotend), and also do some routine maintenance on old printer (tightening bolts, fixing hotend to extruder, checking electronics, etc.); printed one XY joiner V1.5 and one 12mm rod clamp V2.3 type 1 and one V2.4 type 2 12mm rod clamp; also prepare bed for drilling and tapping by marking holes and unwrapping plastic and fetching WD40 and center-punching holes."
118,17/02/19,7,18," try to print second XY Joiner V1.5 but fails due to printer falling of of cabinet from unknown causes. Destroyed 3D printer so research options, (find places to print broken X axis support 3D printed part and also find new frame on eBay for $22.00) but decide to try to repair. So glue back together printed part with strong glue (maybe super glue?) and then solvent weld broken acrylic pieces together again. Also work on wiring for new printer: drilll alot of holes through lack table next to each other to fit all the wires. Also use spare 4-core wire from weather station to wire two enstops together on printer (using common + and gnd and two sig. wires)."
119,18/02/19,6,24," finish fixing old 3D printer and print XY Joiner V1.5, also assemble table from garage and put printer on it clamped in with blocks of wood, notice slight grating in rods but probably not new or important; wire most of new 3D printer: add 3rd endstop to the two wired yesterday and also wire bed in and also wire hotend fan and then test endstops. Also print print cooling fan (hotend fan) vent/air director and test: it works but just pointing air in wrong direction."
120,19/02/19,5,30," print V1.1 hotend mount plate, after tightening notice cracks and subsequently design V2 with new clamping style (two-part clamp), print V2 and test.  Also design and print V1.2 of Fan Vent after noticing points air in wrong direction during testing of V1.1 this morning. Change firmware to setup heat bed controll and the test heat bed (works well when heated to 40 C with thermistor taped to mat as test) Wire hotend: wrap wire-wrap from old 3D printer to bundle wires together, also design clamp for wires on frame/anchor and print, then design V2 after noticing M3 holes not included in design and also print."
121,20/02/19,5,10,"Work on new 3d printer: finish wiring printer: wire hotend heater and hotend cooling fan  (to 12V AUX pins) and print cooling fan and hotend thermistor. Also install wire cable mount for hotend wires and wrap remainging wire wrap around wires from bed. Install PTFE tube into pneunatic coupler and then dril 4mm hole through top Lack table followed by 8 mm hole through very top of table for coupler to mount in, then screw in coupler and test by exctruding filament upto hotend. Also test hotend fan and print cooling fan and hotend upto 50C and bed upto 50C."
122,21/02/19,5,5,"New filament arrives; print X axis carriage, test and find only problem is adjustable bearing, so start modifying design. Also go to Dan's house to use Delta 12 inch drill press and drill holes in aluminum plate with WD40 and 2.5mm and 2mm drill bits."

124,23/02/19,5,2,"Order new hotend from Gulfcoast Robotics on Amazon, should be arriving today.Copy all drawings and misc. files, punch holes and bind and then black out name. Install nuts and screws into carriage v2.0 and also tidy and organise fastners."
125,24/02/19,6,10,"Install new hotend and test: works first but clogs on pulling out filament; fix and then clog again by same problem; then fix and stop pulling out filament and find works very well; saw al. rods to right length and install; add belts and tighten; print Z axis V4 endstop mount but use for X axis; level bed using screws and paper; axes not homing properly so after reversing in firmware and hardware and also rteversing endstops works; do first print. After four tries, (first Z steps/mm off, second and third bowden tube popped out of extruder and needed remounting) finally fourth try worked. Noticed signicant ringing in one axis and not much in the other"
126,25/02/19,5,12,"Print another test cube and change accel. settings  (lower in y axis because of ringing and raise in x) then print another. Figure out ringing in y is because of lack of tolerance in bushings on x axis. Also decide include z raise and lower screw, so create V5 and 5.1 of endstop mount and also Z adjustable screw V1 and V1.1. Then print V5.1 endstop and V1 adj. screw on new 3d printer (come out very well) and then print filler piece to fill 6.2mm hole to 2.5mm for 15mm in adj. screw mount. Instal and endstop notice on wrong side so correcting tommorrow"

128,27/02/19,4,31,Create code for filament runout sensor. order bronze sleeve bearings/bushings and print more of V4.2 bushing holders for them. New bushings arrive and seem to have better tolerance than IGUS.
129,28/02/19,3,28,"Design filament runout sensor clip. Design bushing holder for bronze bushings (V5.0) with ID of 13.0mm and print. Then after does not fit design V5.1 with ID of 13.3mm on design software. Then press fit with panavise 201. Compare to IGUS and have less slop. Install on printer and add light motor oil and works. Next work on endstop mount for X axis. Print rotated clamp version and seems to work except that endstop wrong way around relative to rod, so redesign and reprint and then works.  Printed 3D Benchy"
130,01/03/19,5,32,Design new fan vent for better cooling of prints. Work on testing: create GCODE for speed test (for ringing and accuracy) from 30 to 80 in 10mm/s steps. Also analyze Bency printed on new printer last night at 40mm/s average: seems pretty good with some minor surface imperfections and alot of stringing (easy to remove) from the very low retraction settings. Also priont bency on anet a8 and noticably worse with more ringing and more wobbly in all axes.
131,02/03/19,6,35,"Print V2 of filament runout sensor (designed yesterday evening) and test: find same issues (sensor off-center, etc.), so design V3 and print, test V3 and find all better except endstop will not fit completely in so design V4 and print and install (also glued swith to endstop to prevent movement and drilled holes because creating thread was very difficult). Print all speed vs ringing and accuracy test cubes for new printer (old printer done yesterday). Design paper basket: V1 would take more than one day and half a kg of filament to print so make thinner and reduce to 1/4kg and 20hrs, next make print base smaller and increase acceleration on printer and finally 12hrs ready to print on monday. Now printer in officially finished."
132,04/03/19,1,38,Print basket torture test on printer: many bad starts possibly due to to high travel velocity and also un level bed but add Z hop and lower travel speed and level bed and finally works.
133,05/03/19,5,38,Print basket torture test on printer: many bad starts possibly due to to high travel velocity and also un level bed but add Z hop and lower travel speed and level bed and finally works.
134,06/03/19,2,19,Clean up print of paper basket (remove stringing). Prepare another smaller basket for Anet A8 tomorrow using same profile.
135,07/03/19,0,25,"Print basket for Anet A8: fails several times due to bed sticking issues, but finally succeeds, stringing on this one alot smaller (ore like threads)."
136,08/03/19,6,50,"Start full model of printer in F360, decide print different cubes, calibrate steps/mm of extrdr, X, Y, Z, print new 25mm hollow cube test on both printers from speeds from 30-80 with 10mm/s steps, compare and analyze and fill in results."
137,09/03/19,4,29,New Z motor arrives; print another lead screw restraint and nut mount and find motor will not fit with belts. Design new version of hotend carriage to address ringing and print; also design motor mount for 2nd Z motor before finding won't work.
138,10/03/19,4,37,Print hotend plate; design hotend plate top and also print; assemble parts to make hotend carriage; take apart print and disassemble old hotend carriage; add hotend and fans to new hotend carriage just printed (V3.0)  and assemble; install on printer and works perfectly; level bed and find new dimensions of printer are 307x231x334mm (XxYxZ). Print 80mm/s test cube and find ringing significantly decreased (less than 1/3 of day before yesterday (8-Mar-19) prints). Print another cube at 2500 (2x) accel and find only slightly more ringing so try again at 4000mm/s/s.
139,11/03/19,1,19,Print series of 25mm calibration cubes on new printer (same gcode as on Anet A8 and V2 Hotend Carriage). Analyze; find ringing and smoothness much better than V2 Carriage; add to project board. Print 3D benchy with V3 of carriage.
